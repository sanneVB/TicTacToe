# TicTacToe
TicTacToe project created without tutorials

Very simple manual TicTacToe game. Two players behind the same PC. Symbol placing is handled by clicking of fields. Consecutive clicks cycle the symbol placed. Does not track win-state or which player is currently placing (Cross or Circle)

Good springboard to more automatic versions of TicTacToe
